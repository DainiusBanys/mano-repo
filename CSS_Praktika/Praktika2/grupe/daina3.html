    <h2>Dainos tekstas</h2>
    <pre>
        Time stops for a while.
        Water runs still.
        The river goes up the hill, up the hill.
        Sometimes I fell like a waterfall, like a waterfall
        Sometimes I fell like a waterfall, like a waterfall
        Time stops for a while and water runs still
        No more rush, the river goes up the hill
        Sometimes I fell like a waterfall, like a waterfall
        Sometimes I fell like a waterfall, like a waterfall
        Eternal flow, this miracle gives me wings
        And no one can stop me, time's just playing my strings
        Sometimes I fell like a waterfall, like a waterfall
        Sometimes I fell like a waterfall, like a waterfall
        Little space gods kindly watching through cloudy, stormy sky
        We are children of the time machine
        Who always will ask why, .always will ask why.
        We look up to the sky
        To fly
        To fly.    </pre>
